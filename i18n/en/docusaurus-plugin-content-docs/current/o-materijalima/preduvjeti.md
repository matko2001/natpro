If you already have a basic knowledge of the C ++ programming language and have a text editor installed, you can skip this article.

### C++

In the articles in these materials, we assume that you have at least a basic knowledge of the C ++ programming language. In case you are an absolute beginner, we recommend that you watch some _crash course_ on _YouTube_.

### Text editor

If you have not selected a text editor in which to program, we recommend [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). Some parts of these materials will talk about speeding up code writing speed, and some speeding methods will be specific to VSC. This item is optional, but is definitely recommended if you don't already have a preferred text editor.

### Recommended settings

In the following YouTube videos you can find how to set up an environment that we will use:
- [MinGW & g++](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guM4XS43m4I)
- [VSC installation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGsyJI8XG0Y)
- [Setting up a VSC for programming in C++](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77v-Poud_io)
