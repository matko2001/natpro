### Who are these materials for?

These materials are intended for anyone who wants to improve their knowledge of programming, algorithms, and data structures, those who wish to compete in programming competitions, those who want to learn some "tricks" to solve some problems, those who want to prepare for job interviews and to all others who find the topic of competitive programming interesting. They are also intended for those familiar with the principles of competition programming and want to repeat the material.

### Who created these materials?

Ivan Vlahov, a student at the Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computing, created the page, while the excellent [autori članaka](../doprinos-ovim-materijalima/autori) are responsible for the content on the page.

### What to expect from these materials?

You can expect content that includes the material of computer science competitions for primary and secondary schools, the material of the first and second year of computer science degrees and some mathematical concepts that we will try to explain in a simple enough way to be clear to those who encounter these concepts. You can also expect a lot of examples from real competitions with solutions.

### What not to expect from these materials?

Don’t expect that **just** by readin these materials you will become a great competitor. These materials explain the concepts of competition programming that you can fully learn only by solving tasks that involve those concepts. Just learning the algorithms by heart will not accomplish much, so we advise you to try to solve the tasks located at the ends of the articles.
